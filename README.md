# Tour_De_France Analysis

 # This project explores over a century of Tour de France cycling data to uncover historical patterns and predict future race outcomes using machine learning.


### Key Features:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  Visualized trends in race distance, speed, stage count, and nationality of winners from 1903 to the present.

# Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features such as average speed, race duration, and total distance for predictive modeling.

# Target Encoding: Used LabelEncoder to prepare categorical variables like the winner's country for model training.

# Model Training: Built a Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier to predict the winnerâ€™s country based on race features.

# Evaluation: Measured accuracy and generated confusion matrices and per-country accuracy scores to evaluate performance.

# Insights: Identified dominant cycling nations (e.g., France, Belgium) with high prediction accuracy and visualized misclassification trends (e.g., Spain vs. Italy) using a confusion matrix heatmap.

# Tools & Skills:
# Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, EDA, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Classification Models
