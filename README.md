🚴‍♂️ Tour de France Analysis
This project explores over a century of Tour de France data to uncover historical trends and use machine learning to predict the winner's country based on race characteristics.

🔍 Key Features
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed trends in race distance, average speed, stage count, and nationality of winners from 1903 to the present.

🛠️ Feature Engineering

Created derived features like average speed, race duration, and total distance to enhance predictive performance.

🧬 Target Encoding

Applied LabelEncoder to encode categorical variables (e.g., winner's country) for model compatibility.

🤖 Model Training

Trained a Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier to predict the winner's nationality based on race features.

📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and per-country prediction accuracy.

💡 Insights

Identified dominant cycling nations such as France and Belgium.

Highlighted misclassification patterns (e.g., Spain vs. Italy) with a confusion matrix heatmap.
